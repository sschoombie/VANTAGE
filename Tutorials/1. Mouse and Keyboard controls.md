# VANTAGE controls

## TIME-SERIES plot controls

VANTAGE produces two plots with the time-series data. 

The axes that are plotted can be modified using <i> Plot - Choose axes </i>

The upper plot (A) is a zoomed portion of the total data set (B). If correctly synchronized, the summary plot (B) will be limited to the data that corresponds to a loaded video clip. 
The extent of the zoomed plot will be shown as two vertical red lines on the summary plot.
