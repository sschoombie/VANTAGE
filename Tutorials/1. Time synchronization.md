# Time synchronization

This is one of the main functions of VANTAGE, allowing temporal synchronizaiton of video and time-series data, recorded from different devices (i.e. different time frames).

## 1. Loading data:

### 1.1 Time-series data
Time series data should be successfully loaded via <i> File - Load csv... </i>. If a column named "Timestamp" is not available, the user will be prompted to choose the timestamp column. This should be a column containing both date and time in a single column. 

### 1.2 Video data
If more than one video file is available, all the video files should be located in a single folder. Once the folder is specified (<i> Video - Set video diectory... </i>), a file named <i> vt.csv </i> is created (vt - video times) containing video file names, creation times, and offset values.
### NB! Do not add new video files after the directory is chosen. 

The video files <b> MUST </b> be in .mp4 format and each video file should have a sequential "creation" date. If video files are not in .mp4 format, VANTAGE can convert these to mp4, while preserving the timestamp (<i> Video - Convert video to mp4 </i>). It is important to note that if video files are manipulated (e.g. converting, cutting, enhancing, etc.) outside of VANTAGE, the timestamp may be altered, in which case synchronization of multiple video files will not be possible.

## 2 Synchronize time

Once video and time-series data is loaded the following screen should be visible:

### 2.1 Manual synchronization
Here, the user will manually identify corresponding points in the time-series and video data respectively. 
This can be done by recording a calibration sequence prior to deployment, e.g. by shaking an accelerometer tag while the video is filming

OR

by finding high dynamic movement such as a penguin shaking its feathers.

The time-frames are synchronized by choosing a specific point in the time-series data, using the <b> MIDDLE MOUSE BOTTON </b> - a green line will appear at the chosen point. 
Then, using the "<b> SYNC </b>" button (found below the video frame) the offset between the two data sets are saved and applied to sychronize the time frames. 

The colour of the SYNC button will change from red to green when the time has been synchronized. This has to be done once for each video clip, after which the software will read the offset values from the "vt.csv" file on subsequent uses.
